### Day 3 - Memory Spirals

I had a horrible time with this. I stayed up late, then was too tired, and gave up
after an hour.

Came back this morning and made some pretty ugly C++ to solve parts 1 + 2.

```
Enter a value (or -1 to quit part 1)
347991
Rings 296
Side  591
Pos   185
Of    348100
Dist  480
-1
Enter a value for part 2
347991
...output redacted...
349975
```
